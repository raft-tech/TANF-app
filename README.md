## Office of Family Assistance (OFA) & Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Data Portal.

Welcome to the home of the TANF Data Portal (TDP), a new software development project from the Office of Family Assistance (OFA), an office within the Administration for Children Families (ACF).

## What We're Building and Why

- [Product planning page]( https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/README.md) includes latest information on our product mission, goals, roadmap, and backlog. 

## Getting Started

### Running the Application locally

Both the frontend (`http://localhost:3000`) and the backend (`http://localhost:8080`) applications run within Docker.  Instructions for running these containers are below:

```
$ cd tdrs-frontend && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
$ cd tdrs-backend && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d 
```

After the above commands there will be a total of 5 running containers

```

## Infrastructure

TDP Uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevSecOps automation

### Authentication

[Login.gov](https://login.gov/) TDP requires strong multi-factor authentication for the states, tribes, and territories and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication for OFA staff. Login.gov is being used to meet both of these requirements. 

### Cloud Environment

[Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) is being used as the cloud environment. This platform-as-a-service (PaaS) removes almost all of the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance from the system, is already procured for OFA, and has a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board Provisional Authority to Operate (JAB P-ATO) on file. 

## CI/CD Pipelines with CircleCI

### Continuous Integration (CI)

On each git push and merge, a comprehensive list of automated checks are run: Unit tests ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)), Integration tests (Cypress), Linting tests ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), Accessibility tests ([Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/)), and Security Scanning ([OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)). The configurations for CI are kept in [`.circleci/config.yml`](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml). 

### Continuous Deployment

The application is continuously deployed to the dev, vendor staging, gov staging or prod environments based on the git branch the code is merged in. The configuration for different branches is maintained in [`.circleci/config.yml`](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml#L107).

See [Architecture Decision Record 008 - Deployment Flow](docs/Architecture%20Decision%20Record/008-deployment-flow.md) - for more.

The application is deployed to the following environments:

Environment | URL | Git Branch
------------|----|-------------
Development | https://tdp-frontend.app.cloud.gov/ | `raft-review` in [Raft fork](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app)
Vendor staging | https://tdp-frontend-vendor-staging.app.cloud.gov/ | `raft-tdp-main` in [Raft fork](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app)
Gov staging | TBD | TBD
Production | TBD | TBD

### Manual Deployments

The application can be manually deployed from any open Pull Request by assigning the label `Deploy with CircleCI`.

This works using a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) that runs every time a label is assigned to a PR.
If the assigned label matches the string defined above a cURL request is made to CircleCI to initiate a deploy job for the given PR's branch.

Which deployment environment within Cloud.gov the deploy job targets depends on the branch name as follows:
* Branch name `staging` => deploys to Gov Staging **(once it exists)
* Branch name `raft-tdp-main` => deploys to Vendor Staging
* All other branches deploy to the Development environment

Note that the Production environment is omitted above, since `main` is a protected branch commits can't be made directly
to it so there is no path to be able to deploy straight to Production from labels on PRs.

#### Communication around Deployments

To prevent interrupting ongoing testing against a deployment environment it is important to always communicate with the Team
before assigning this label to a new PR. This can be done as a general announcement in either Mattermost (vendor environments)
or MSFT Teams (gov staging).

#### Enabling the Deployment GitHub Action

Currently the GitHub action defined in the workflow in this repo is only enabled on the `raft-tech` fork.

In order to enable the action take the following steps:

* Create a CircleCI API Token in Project Settings
  * NOTE: You can't see this again so make sure to save it in a secure place before proceeding.
 
![circleci_api_token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22626085/110530772-d472e680-80e8-11eb-9869-13217dc1785d.png)

* Save the token from above as a Repository Secret in GitHub
  * NOTE: The secret must be named `CIRCLE_CI_API_TOKEN` exactly or the workflow won't run

* Ensure that actions are enabled for the repository
