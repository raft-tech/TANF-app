## What We're Building and Why

The [Background folder](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/tree/main/docs/Background) contains great briefings on the nature of this project, as well as useful [terminology](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Background/Project-Glossary.md) for navigating and understanding documents and other artifacts relating to it. The [Product Strategy](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/tree/main/docs/Product-Strategy) folder outlines our approach to user research and its integration alongside development and product management processes. The [Vision and Stakeholders](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Product-Strategy/Vision-and-Stakeholders.md) document is particularly relevant to ongoing User Research operationsâ€”particularly the linked [Theory of Change](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1591840529923/e32ad1cccedbaaa6a77e95ddfd9339a8f7a2a37d) board which maps what the TANF program is ultimately trying to achieve and how the program activities should lead to that impact. [The Process Map](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/officeoffamilyassistance2744/1608314993566/5724cd3c3e5e964ab9c85743e5b8e1d89c767788?sender=mreiter1745) may be useful for understanding the more granular systems and processes connected to steps within the Theory of Change.

## How We're Working

The Design folder contains two resources important for our approach to Human-Centered Design in the context of the TDP project. [Design Principles](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Design/Design-Principles.md) and the [Design Guide](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Design/Design-Guide.md) respectively cover actionable principles that should be served in all TDP designs and more granular methods for delivering on them when it comes to accessibility, visual design, content in TDP, and practices for managing artifacts we create along the way (including conventions to follow for markdown documents). The [User Research Guide](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/User-Research-Guide.md) covers practices and considerations for ensuring participant privacy and safety (including psychological safety).

## Research Roadmap

The [Research Roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/raft2792/m/raft2792/1627058877512/7514d3617f4bc241d3f70ff6e61253e1ce09f880?sender=mreiter1745) is a living document created to support our agile processes and approach to release planning in the post-ATO phase of the TDP project we're now in. Its goals include:

- Support the overall team's alignment on *what* needs to be researched and delivered to support functionality in the [Product Roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/raft2792/m/raft2792/1621347373680/75cdd996c2ef8cf2a46825705fb7d7b38727f77d).
- Support the design team in determining research strategy.
- Support the design team in pre-planning research to reduce the planning lift of prioritizing any given research topic.

## Research Syntheses

With a few exceptions, we've tended to publish markdown research syntheses to summarize larger, multi-sprint research activities and studies rather than publishing individual documents for each research session; these larger research efforts are what "Rounds" refer to. The below syntheses are organized reverse-chronologically from newest to oldest:

### [2021, Fall - Investigating Partial Submission & Evaluating TDP Submission History](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Experience/Research-Syntheses/2021%2C%20Fall%20-%20Investigating%20Partial%20Submission%20%26%20Evaluating%20TDP%20Submission%20History.md)

- Ran a series of collaborative workshops with DIGIT and OFA regional staff to prioritize and sort which attributes should be displayed at the top level of submission history pages in TDP and capture preferences around the minimum viable attributes to be displayed.
- Ran a series of research sessions with grantees to investigate the impact of partial resubmission no longer being accepted in TDP and capture grantee preferences around minimum viable attributes on the Submission History page. 
- Evaluated whether grantees understood new submission status states (Accepted, Accepted with errors, and Rejected) and correctly predict what their next steps would be to act on those statuses.
 

### [2021, Summer - Communicating Errors in TDP & Validations With Regional Staff](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2021%2C%20Summer%20-%20Communicating%20Errors%20in%20TDP%20%26%20Validations%20With%20Regional%20Staff.md)

- Ran collaborative workshops with DIGIT to capture the full scope of pre-parsing errors that could prevent TDRS/TDP from being able to process grantee files.
  - Content tested three errors with grantees to identify do's and don'ts and generally investigate which factors determine whether an error is understandable and actionable for grantee data analysts who will receive them.
- Ran collaborative workshops to capture insights from OFA regional staff regarding their roles and responsibilities
  - Began investigating the grantee information regional staff would need to be able to administrate grantee user access in their region; how to make this process secure as well as operationally simple. 



### [2021, Spring - Evil User Journeys & TANF Data Errors (Round 6)](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2021%2C%20Spring%20-%20Evil%20User%20Journeys%20%26%20TANF%20Data%20Errors%20(Round%206).md)

- Ran collaborative project team workshops to identify bad-faith use cases of TDP and other system vulnerabilities.
  - Created "Evil User" personas to synthesize the above workshops.
- Ran collaborative workshops to align the DIGIT (OFA Data Analysts) and design team on current TDRS errors.
  - Ranked the severity of errors and brainstormed ways to "slice" them to scope research into them. 



### [2021, Spring - Tribal MVP (Release 2) Design Sprint](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2021%2C%20Spring%20-%20Tribal%20MVP%20(Release%202)%20Design%20Sprint.md)

- Captured generative insights from Tribes that were underrepresented in past research. 
- Concept tested TDP features that would be needed to support an MVP release specifically for Tribes (to facilitate their move away from email transmission).
  - Identified gaps in functionality we'd identified for that Tribal MVP.



### [STT Attribute Guide](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/STT%20attribute%20guide.md)

- Defined terms and organizational principles useful for navigating STT Attribute excel documents compiled (and maintained) as tools to support research recruitment. 



### [2021, Winter - Prioritizing Pain Points and Scoping Personas](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/Winter%202021%2C%20Round%204%20Synthesis.md)

- Ran collaborative design workshops with grantee participants to validate personas and ensure that their highest priority pain points were captured accurately. 



### [2020, Fall - Understanding STT Roles, Source of Truth, and Metadata](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2020%2C%20Fall%20-%20Understanding%20STT%20Roles%2C%20Source%20of%20Truth%2C%20and%20Metadata.md)

- Concept tested [early ideas](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/tree/main/docs/User-Research/2020%2C%20Fall%20-%20Concept%20Prototypes) about how TDP might capture report metadata (e.g. associated Quarter, Fiscal Year, etc...) and present errors to users. 
- Further investigated of grantee processes, tools, needs, and pain points.
  - Particular focus on case management systems and how data moves between systems.



### [Flat File Metadata Guide](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/Flat%20File%20Metadata%20Guide.md)

- Identified and documented the structure and meaning of flat file metadata to support project team alignment on how TDRS parses files and what information is contained at the highest level of those files.



### [2020, Summer - Understanding the OFA Experience](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2020%2C%20Summer%20-%20Understanding%20the%20OFA%20Experience.md)

- Concept tested TDP user management interfaces with OFA Analysts.
- Investigated how OFA Analysts think about best practices, manage processes around grantee submissions, and what their pain points are in identifying and overseeing the correction of errors.



### [2020, Spring - Understanding the local experience](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2020%2C%20Spring%20-%20Understanding%20the%20local%20experience.md)

- Evaluated early design concepts examining potential stop-gap methods of reducing the grantee pain that came with Extranet being sunset for security reasons.  
- Investigated grantee processes, tools, needs, and pain points.
