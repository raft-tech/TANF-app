## Content guide
We're continuing to learn about the content needs of the new TDRS. Future teams should plan to write in plain language and continually test site navigation and comprehension.

**Resources:**
* [ACF content guide](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/digital-toolbox/content)
* [plainlanguage.gov](https://plainlanguage.gov/)
* [18F content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/)

## Accessibility
Everyone who works on government websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. The new TDRS should meet [508 accessibility standards](https://www.section508.gov/) and use accessible design and development best practices.

### USWDS
We'll be using the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), a design system for the federal government, for a new TDRS system. USWDS provides us with UX guidance and code for [common UI components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/) and also [guidance on how to comply with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experiences Act (IDEA)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/?dg)
