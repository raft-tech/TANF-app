# Workshop Facilitation Guide for Round 4 Research

We will use the [facilitation guide](https://app.zenhub.com/files/281707402/8b6beb37-9f66-4526-a6a7-97707f1146ec/download) to conduct the States and Territories (ST) workshop. The objective of this collaborative design workshop is to involve grantees in: 
- Solution space validation
- Journey map validation 
- User flow ideation 

### Workshop agenda:
#### Introduction: 25 minutes 
In this step we introduce the OFA-Raft Team, give an overview, define a "user flow," do a warm-up/ice-breaker, and then recap on what we will cover today. 
- Overview
- Ice Breaker

#### Solution Space: 10 Minutes  
In this step, we briefly revisit the problem we are solving and why it is important, for participants who are new to the process. We will realign around the who, what, where, when, and why, and tie it to the TDP product vision.

  - Presentation of solution space
  - User validation of solution space
  
#### Journey Map to User Flow: 45 minutes  
In this step we will narrate the journey as we currently understand it, ask for ST input on any thing we may have missed, and prioritize pain points.  Then we will present a solution user flow and ask for ST input .  
  - Presentation of Current Journey
  - Pain Point Validation --> Prioritization
  - User Flow Ideation Session
