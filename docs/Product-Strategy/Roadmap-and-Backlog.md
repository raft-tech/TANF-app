# Product Roadmap
Our [roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1592336604317/61159efd030645a74c267130ea19b2083f87dd09) ðŸ”’  represents our latest thinking about the order in which weâ€™ll tackle the various pieces of the overarching problem.

**_This roadmap is not a promise. The order of these items is likely to change as we discuss options and learn more._**

## ATO & OFA MVP Scope
Our first release will produce an application that could be used by OFA Admin staff, but our primary goal is to get Authority to Operate (ATO), which will allow us to have a production environment. Below is a list of functionality that will be included in this release.

| Functionality | Status | 
| -------- | ------- | 
| User can log in using login.gov | Complete
| Users with appropriate privileges can manage users | Complete
| Users can upload data files by section and quarter | In Progress
| Users with appropriate privileges can download files that were previously uploaded     | In Progress

## Tribal MVP Scope
The next release will focus on enabling a subset of tribes to use the upload functionality. This will allow our application to provide value to one of our key user groups early on. We are currently in the research portion of understanding what this could look like. 

## STT MVP scope
In addition to the work mentioned above, we are looking forward in our research plans to develop functionality that will serve the rest of our users that includes (but is not limited to) focusing on data cleansing and validation. 
## Backlog
The backlog can be found in the [raft-tech fork of the TANF-app GitHub public repository](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues).
