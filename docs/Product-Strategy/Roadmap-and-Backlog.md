## Product Roadmap
Our [roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1592336604317/61159efd030645a74c267130ea19b2083f87dd09) prioritizes represents our latest thinking about the order in which we’ll tackle the various pieces of the overarching problem.

**_This roadmap is not a promise. The order of these items is likely to change as we discuss options and learn more._**

Right now, we think the best place to start is just getting getting quality data from grantees to OFA. Down the road, we believe the focus will shift to documenting reporting history and devising insights from grantee data.

1. Decide whether to use and then adapt prototype or vendor's other project
2. Users can log into new system
3. Users can easily upload data
4. Users can view  uploads
5. Users can run automatic data validation check
6. Users can edit data
7. OFA staff have access to data
8. Grantees can officially submit a file to OFA
9. User can manually enter data
10. Grantees can easily resubmit data

## Backlog
The backlog can be found in the [raft-tech fork of the TANF-app GitHub public repository](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues).
