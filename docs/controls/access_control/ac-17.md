# Access Control
## AC-17 - Remote Access

The organization:  
a. Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and  
b. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.  

### TDP Implementation

All users who access the TDP application are required to authenticate through Login.gov and Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). Developers will also have access to  the Cloud.gov web interface and CLI as well as the Cloud Foundry CLI in the `development` and `vendor-staging` environments.
