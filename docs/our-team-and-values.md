## Our Mission
We strive to build a secure, accessible, and usable web platform for efficient data reporting and analytics that will ultimately help improve the lives of low-income families.


## Our Vision 
Our team will build a new, secure, web-based data reporting system to improve the federal reporting experience for TANF grantees and federal staff. The new system will allow grantees to easily submit accurate data and be confident that they have fulfilled their reporting requirements. This will reduce the burden on all users, improve data quality, inform better policy and programs, and ultimately help low-income families. 
 
## Our Values 

- **We work together and ask for help.** We don‚Äôt fall into a pit of silence trying to solve or finish something alone. Pairing is the norm. We are a team and should feel comfortable asking for help when it is needed.  
- **We invite feedback and give it graciously.** We ask for feedback early and often. We trust our teammates to tell us when we can do better. We share with the team  our preferences about giving and receiving feedback.
- **We reflect on our own process and behaviors.** We acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them. It‚Äôs only ‚Äúfailure‚Äù if you fail to learn from it. We constantly look to refine and improve how we work together. 
- **We assume best intent.** We separate intention from impact. Use specific examples, and avoid generalizations. Forgive. 
- **We default to openness and transparency.** We ask questions and discuss issues in open channels (i.e. Mattermost and Github) whenever possible. Don‚Äôt be afraid to surface problems that you may become aware of, ‚Äúping‚Äù a teammate on a stale ticket, or provide feedback. Acknowledge and discuss things that aren‚Äôt working well (without blame or judgement) with an eye towards improvements. Have a real chat about resolving something rather than perpetuating misunderstandings.  
- **We state our goals explicitly and follow up on our commitments.** Whether it is a team meeting, sprint goal, project milestone, retrospective, or one-on-one sync, we state our goals at the beginning and follow-up continuously. We adjust our goals, as necessary, by providing each other with honest feedback along the way.
