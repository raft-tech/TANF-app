# Welcome

Hi hello! Welcome to the project docs for the New TANF Data Reporting System (i.e. TANF Data Portal)! This is where we keep our background, design, and development documentation.

Our vision is to build a new, secure, web-based data reporting system to improve the federal reporting experience for TANF grantees and federal staff. The new system will allow grantees to easily submit accurate data and be confident that they have fulfilled their reporting requirements. This will reduce the burden on all users, improve data quality, lead to better policy and program decision-making, and ultimately help low-income families.

## TANF Program Theory of Change
We used a Theory of Change model to understand what the TANF program is ultimately trying to achieve and how the program activities should lead to that impact. Within these activities, we can see who contributes to and who relies on TANF data reporting.

![TANF Theory of Change model maps program activities to ultimate impact](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/master/design-assets/research-artifacts/TANF%20Theory%20of%20Change.png?raw=true)

We may adjust the [Theory of Change](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1591840529923/e32ad1cccedbaaa6a77e95ddfd9339a8f7a2a37d) as we understand dependencies more.


## Project Stakeholders
We've developed a [stakeholder map](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/officeoffamilyassistance2744/1595350408063/bd16524a57c6750b5ced4fbfe054ab011a2f6a3f) to outline the different groups that are affected by this project. Some groups directly interact with TDRS, while others contribute or are influenced by TANF data indirectly.

We've included more detail about TDRS audiences in on our [user types page](../User-Research/Stakeholders-and-Personas.md).
