## Team Charter

The goal of our charter is to document our commitments to specific behaviors and norms that our team will practice during this partnership. Creating alignment about our ways of working will help us avoid and productively resolve conflicts. This is a living document. We will add and edit as the team makes new commitments and processes changes.
