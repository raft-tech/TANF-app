# **Definition of Done**
In order to define an issue as done, it needs to have passed a Raft Review and the [QASP Review](../Quality-Expectations.md) and follows [our branching strategy](../Branching-Strategy.md) which results in the code being available in the HHS/TANF-app repo.

This [checklist](../../Technical-Documentation/qasp-operational-checklist.md) needs to be completed, following [Raft's accessibility guidelines](../../Technical-Documentation/rafts-accessibility-dos-and-donts.md)
